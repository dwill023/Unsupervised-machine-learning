# Unsupervised-machine-learning
Using the k-means clusting method.

By scraping tables from Wikipedia publicly available data on wildfires and weather data from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/county/mapping/4/tavg/202003/12/value) can be used to help make predictions on whether a wildfire will be observed. Data was gathered for t he last 10 years for temperature, precipitation and on wildfires that have burned more than 1,000 acres (400 ha).

This data can be used to train a k-means cluster model that will partition the observed wildfires. 

The steps to performing this analysis can be viewed in the Jupyter notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dwill023/Unsupervised-machine-learning/blob/main/Predicting%20California%20wildfires%20using%20k-means%20clustering.ipynb).
